### v2.1.1 (2017-04-03):

* Fixed build error on Windows thanks to Maximilian Haupt (@0x7f).

* Added C++-layer unit testing using [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest).

* Updated readme with correct installation for the New Relic Agent v1.

### v2.1.0 (2017-02-06):

* Added an event loop CPU usage metric.

  The module will now report round trip CPU usage metrics for Node's event loop. This
  metric can be read off with `nativeMetrics.getLoopMetrics()` and will
  represent the amount of CPU time per tick of the event loop.

### v2.0.2 (2017-01-19):

* Removed pre-compiling binaries using the `node-pre-gyp` module.

  Previously we provided pre-compiled binaries for certain platforms and versions of Node.
  However, this caused issues for customers using shrinkwrapping.  In order to support
  shrinkwrapping as well as all versions of Node and npm that our customers use, we have
  decided to remove this feature.  This means that in order to use this module, users now
  need to have a compiler on the machine where it is being installed.
  See [node-gyp] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp#installation) for more
  information on compiling native addons.

### v2.0.0 (2017-01-04):

* Removed support for Node 0.10.

  The `segfault-handler` dependency no longer compiles on Node 0.10 in our tests.

* The `node-pre-gyp` module is now a bundled dependency.

  Previously it was installed using a preinstall script, which was causing an issue with
  shrinkwrapping parent projects.  Thanks to Robert Rossman (@Alaneor) for
  the contribution!

* Added License section to the Readme file.

### v1.0.0 (2016-12-07):

* General release. No code changes from v0.1.1.

### v0.1.1 (2016-12-05):

* Added guard against binding GC events more than once.

* Removed OS X from Travis to temporarily get around extremely long builds.
  Added script to run tests locally across multiple versions of Node.

* Added test for checking licenses of dependencies.

### v0.1.0 (2016-11-29):

* Added `gc` event with duration and type of garbage collection.
* Added `usage` event with current and diff of resource usage stats.
